00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,560
Gentlemen, <i>Star Wars</i> Day

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,560
is rapidly approaching.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,360
We should finalize our plans.

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,540
What? That's a real thing?

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,670
What is it, <i>Star Wars</i> Christmas?

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,240
No. Don't be ridiculous.

7
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,280
That's Wookie Life Day.

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,780
So when is it?

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,450
Well, it's not May the fifth,

10
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,050
and it's not May the third...

11
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,930
It's May the fourth.

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,790
Get it?

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,540
May the "fourth" be with you?

14
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,660
"May the force be with you."

15
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,660
Get it?

16
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,270
Oh, no, this face

17
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,270
wasn't because I didn't get it.

00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,070

Hey, you got a second?

22
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,370
Yes. Actually, I'm glad you're here.

23
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,480
I'm working on

24
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,480
the <i>Star Wars</i> Day schedule.

25
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,210
Now, I have a window built in

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,210
after <i>Phantom Menace,</i>

27
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,320
for complaining, but...

28
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,150
...I'm worried an hour

29
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,150
won't be enough time.

30
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,560
Sheldon, I've got some bad news.

31
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,420
What is it?

32
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,490
I just read online that

33
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,490
Arthur Jeffries passed away.

34
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,570
Professor Proton is dead?

35
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,470
Sorry, buddy.

36
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,820
What are you doing?

37
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,320
Comforting you?

38
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,490
Your heart might be

39
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,490
in the right place,

40
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,920
but your head, chest

41
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,920
and arms certainly aren't.

42
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,100
Anyway, the funeral's on Sunday.

43
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,630
But, that's <i>Star Wars</i> Day.

44
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,860
Yeah...

45
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,270
Of all the things about this

46
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,270
that are sad,

47
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,340
that might not be number one.

48
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,840
You OK?

49
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,840
I know he meant a lot to you.

50
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,950
I'm fine.

51
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,950
OK.

52
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,150
Yet he cried when they changed

Watching your

old friend?

68
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,560
Yes. Look at him, Amy.

69
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,230
It's such a shame.

70
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,160
Struck down

71
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,160
in the prime of my life.

72
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,700
Do you want me to go to

73
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,700
the funeral with you?

74
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,200
- I'm not going to the funeral.

75
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,200
- Why not?

76
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,430
All those people

77
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,430
blowing their noses.

78
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,400
You can't tell the sick

79
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,400
from the sad.

80
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,450
I'll be at home celebrating

81
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,450
<i>Star Wars</i> Day, as planned.

82
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,910
Are you sure you don't

83
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,910
want to go say good-bye?

84
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,390
Amy, mourning the inevitable

85
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,390
is a complete waste of time.

86
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,920
And watching a bunch

87
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,920
of goofy space movies

88
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,430
you've seen hundreds

89
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,430
of times isn't?

90
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,060
If we were in

91
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,060
a physical relationship,

92
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,600
you just lost sex tonight.

93
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,400
Hey, guys.

94
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,840
Hey, Penny.

95
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,840
Happy <i>Star Wars</i> Day.

96
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,500
OK.

97
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,840
Can I make you breakfast?

98
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,180
Admiral Ackbar's Snack Bar

99
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,180
is open for business.

100
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,340
No, thanks. Leonard and I

101
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,340
are just going to the funeral.

102
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,420
You sure? Not even coffee?

103
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,320
We have R2-Decaf.

104
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,220
Maybe a nice Cafe Au Leia?

105
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,020
And if you're not

106
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,020
in the mood for coffee,

107
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,260
I can always make you

108
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,260
a Chai Tea-3PO.

109
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,370
I get it--like C-3PO.

110
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,040
What happened to me?

111
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,270
- Hey, Sheldon, you want anything?

112
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,270
- No, thank you.

113
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,000
You're being so quiet.

114
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,440
Are you upset

115
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,440
or are you just rebooting?

116
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,240
I'm fine.

117
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,150
Sweetie, are you sure you don't want

118
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,150
to come with us to the funeral?

119
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,450
I appreciate the offer,

120
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,450
but Arthur is gone

121
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,350
and there's nothing

122
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,350
I can do about it.

123
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,790
When Darth Vader

124
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,790
struck down Obi-Wan,

125
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,930
did Luke cry like a baby

126
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,930
and go to his funeral?

127
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,620
No, he blew up the Death Star.

128
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,560
Why do I know this?!

129
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,930
Arthur Jeffries was a scientist.

130
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,970
I'm sure he didn't care about

131
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,970
silly superstitions like funerals.

132
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,370
You know, if he were here,

133
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,880
I think he'd say,

134
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,880
"Enjoy <i>Star Wars</i> Day."

135
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,380
He was 84.

136
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,380
He'd say, "Where's my pudding?"

137
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,380
Before you go, at least

138
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,380
let me pack you some

139
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,650
Attack of the Scones

140
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,650
for the road.

141
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,920
Oh, like <i>Attack of the Clones.</i>

142
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,030
We are leaving right now!

143
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,960
Arthur passing away

144
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,960
was harder on Sheldon

145
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,430
than he's ready to admit.

146
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,790
Really hoping this will cheer him up.

147
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,400
Me, too.

148
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,000
Although, it might've been

149
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,000
thoughtless of us

150
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,730
to bake a Death Star cake.

151
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,880
No, it combines two of

152
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,880
Sheldon's favorite things:

153
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,710
chocolate chips and the ability

154
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,710
to destroy a planet

155
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,440
at the push of a button.

156
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,880
Well, anyway, it'll be

157
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,880
a nice surprise for the boys.

158
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,080
And Howie doesn't think

159
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,080
I take his interests seriously,

160
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,590
so hopefully this will keep

161
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,590
him fooled for a while.

162
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,560
OK, let's get the fondant

163
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,560
and start decorating.

164
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,060
This is pretty cool.

165
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,530
You don't see too many

166
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,530
spherical cakes.

167
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,760
(SPLATS)

168
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,170
I wonder why that is.

169
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,540
I have a confession to make.

170
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,540
I've never been

171
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,540
to a funeral before.

172
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,720
Really?

173
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,580
I just never knew anyone that died.

174
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,180
I had a pet pig

175
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,180
when I was a kid.

176
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,480
I mean, when he died,

177
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,480
we didn't have a funeral,

178
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,380
we had a barbecue.

179
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,930
Yeah, we won't be

180
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,930
eating Arthur tonight.

181
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,590
I didn't know him very well,

182
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,590
but I still really liked him.

183
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,830
It's weird that he's... just gone.

184
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,470
I know.

185
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,870
I feel like I want to cry.

186
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,870
Oh, that's... that's fine.

187
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,380
Go ahead.

188
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,020
I can't do it with you staring at me.

189
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,520
Sorry.

190
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,920
No, I'm dry.

191
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,930

Since we all agree

Yeah, Howard,

220
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,860
I think you of all people

221
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,750
should avoid espousing

00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,750

that if something

230
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,830
then skip Episode I,

231
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,130
watch II and III

00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,130

Get rid of the trade route part?

00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,970
Fine. Would you feel

better if I propose

365
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,540
so you could turn

366
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,540
me down again?

00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,030
we didn't see it.

383
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,430
I never watched him, either,

384
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,430
but he seems to be the reason

385
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,300
that Sheldon got interested

386
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,300
in science.

387
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,200
Not me. I got into science

388
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,940
'cause I was always

389
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,940
the smallest kid in school,

390
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,940
so I thought if I

391
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,940
became a scientist,

392
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,840
I could invent a formula

393
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,840
that made me taller.

394
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,540
That's cute.

395
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,880
Yeah, I thought it was working

396
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,880
for a while,

397
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,180
but then I found out

398
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,180
my brother was just

399
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,320
lowering the pencil marks

400
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,320
on the door frame.

401
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,860
How about you?

402
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,430
Oh, I guess it must have been

403
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,430
back when I was in the Girl Sprouts.

404
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,500
Girl Sprouts?

405
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,760
My mom made it up as an

406
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,760
alternative to the Girl Scouts.

407
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:41,410
She didn't want me selling cookies

408
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:41,410
on some street corner "like a whore."

409
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,170
How did that get

410
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,170
you into science?

411
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,910
Oh, I went to the library

412
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,910
and took out a book on biology

413
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,050
to see what whores did.

414
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,920
On the one hand,

415
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,920
if I say yes...

416
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,890
This isn't funny anymore.

417
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,560
Just say no

418
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,560
so we're done with this.

419
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,030
Will you marry me or not?

420
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,100
Ooh, interesting. Did you just

421
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,100
propose to me again?

422
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,830
No.

423
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,230
Really? Because I just heard,

424
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,230
"Will you marry me?"

425
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,430
That's two proposals,

426
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,430
one day.

427
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,670
Sounds like someone wants

428
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,670
to spend the rest of her life

429
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,610
telling people how to spell

430
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,610
the name Hofstadter.

431
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,810
You know what? Fine.

432
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,810
Do whatever you want.

433
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,550
Hey.

434
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,160
Penny, don't get upset.

435
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,020
Here.

436
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,960
I love you, but, no,

437
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,960
I will not marry you.

438
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,600
Thank you.

439
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,570
Now, about that second proposal.

440
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,570
On the one hand...

441
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,880
Where... where... where are we?

442
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,080
This is the swampland

443
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,080
of Dagobah.

444
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,250
It's where Luke was trained

445
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,250
in the ways of the Jedi.

446
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:06,590
Too bad.

447
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:06,590
I thought it was Florida.

448
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,130
When Obi-Wan came to Luke

449
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,130
on this very spot,

450
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,030
he gave him all sorts

451
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,030
of helpful advice.

452
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,000
So, um...

453
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,370
...what do you got for me?

454
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:26,780
Um...

455
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,340
Always...

456
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,040
...get... get a prenup.

457
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,620
That's it?

458
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,850
I thought there'd be more

459
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,850
of a reason why you're here.

460
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,500
Well, why do you think I'm here?

461
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:49,070
I suppose it has something to do

462
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:49,070
with your recent passing.

463
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:53,000
Is this the... the first time

464
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:53,000
you've lost, you know,

465
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,540
someone close to you?

466
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,040
Oh, no. No.

467
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:01,310
I've already had to say good-bye

468
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:01,310
to 11 Dr. Whos.

469
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:08,310
Yeah, I've... I've outlived

470
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:08,310
a few of my doctors, too.

471
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,390
Of course, my grandfather

472
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,390
died when I was five.

473
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:15,030
My father died when I was 14.

474
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:18,060
I'm... I'm sorry about that.

475
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,060
And now you're gone, too.

476
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:24,660
It's like all the men I've

477
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:24,660
looked up to have gone away.

478
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:30,100
Well, you know, it's...

479
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:30,100
it's OK to...

480
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,740
...to be sad about them.

481
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:36,650
Just... just make sure,

482
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:36,650
you know, you appreciate...

483
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,250
...those who...

484
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,250
who are still there for you.

485
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,050
But I do appreciate them.

486
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,960
Well, then...

487
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,030
...what am I doing in a swamp...

488
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,670
...dressed like Friar Tuck?

489
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,910

494
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,420
I'm OK.

00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,490

496
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,790
It was nice, you know.

497
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,120
A lot of people showed up,

498
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,170
told some great stories about him.

499
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:29,770

- I do.

506
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:55,230
watch one through five first.

507
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,430
- Sheldon, that'll take us all night.

508
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,430
- That's true.

509
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,870

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,410
is a little tough to watch.

513
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,450
At least they toned him down

514
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,450
in the second one.

515
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,780
Yeah, he is pretty stupid.

we had to miss the movies,
